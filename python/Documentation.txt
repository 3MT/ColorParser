color.py

Contains: color object

Constructor:
color(float r, float g, float b)
 r - Red value of color.
 g - Green value of color.
 b - Blue value of color.

Functions:
color.printColor()
 Prints the contents of the color in the format "Color(r,g,b)".



colorparser.py

Contains: colorparser interface

Functions:
parseText(string text)
 Takes a raw string of input e.g. "bright orange" and returns a suitable color object (if it can) throws NameError('ColorNotFound') if no color matches.



main.py

Contains: Main loop and automated test data

Functions:
testColors()
 Automatically inputs lots of input and gets the returned values from colorparser. Doesn't actually check if output is valid, that has to be done by hand (since it's a little subjective) but it saves some time.

main loop
 Asks for color input, then if the user desires it, it'll pop up an OGL window showing what the color they specified looks like. It also prints the contents of the color object. Enterring test will run the test data. Enterring quit will end the program.
